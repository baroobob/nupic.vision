## This project is in Maintenance Mode

We plan to do minor releases only, and limit changes in NuPIC and NuPIC Core to:

- Fixing critical bugs.
- Features needed to support ongoing research.

This tool kit is intended to help people who are interested in using Numenta's 
nupic on vision related problems.

An simple example of how these tools can be used:

```
# get training data set 
images, tags = dataset_readers.getImagesAndTags(trainingXMLFileName)
# convert images to bit vectors 
vectors = image_encoders.imagesToVectors(images)

# train nupic on the data set for a maximum of 10 repetitions 
VisionTestBench.train(vectors,tags,10)

# get testing data set 
images, tags = dataset_readers.getImagesAndTags(testingXMLFileName)
# convert images to bit vectors 
vectors = image_encoders.imagesToVectors(images)
# test nupic's image recognition accuracy 
VisionTestBench.test(vectors,tags)
```

Look at demo.py for a more detailed example. To run the demo do this:
